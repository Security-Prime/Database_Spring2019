Database Project: Developed Staples Online database

Milestone 1: 
  Documentation Introduction
  Requirements Document
  E-R Diagram
  
Milestone 2:
  Setup at least ten (different) database tables – 10 tables, not 10 entity sets (so relationship sets (“diamonds”) and tables for multi-   valued attributes count as well)
  Populate the database table with good data
  Add special SQL command (trigger, assertion, constraints, etc.)
  Print out the schema using phpMyAdmin
  
Milestone 3:
  Setup limited users to access the DB
  Finish coding the SQL commands (insert, update, more selects, etc)
  Do the 3NF proof to show that DB is in a good form
